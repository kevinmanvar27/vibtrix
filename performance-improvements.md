# Performance Improvements and SPA Behavior Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to improve performance and ensure proper SPA (Single Page Application) behavior in the Vibtrix application.

## 1. Navigation Improvements

### Fixed Client-Side Navigation

- Replaced `window.location.href` with Next.js's `router.push()` for client-side navigation
- Created an `EnhancedLink` component that ensures proper client-side navigation
- Added navigation utilities to help with client-side navigation
- Updated components to use client-side navigation instead of full page reloads

### Exceptions for Authentication

- Maintained full page reloads for authentication-related routes where necessary
- Added clear comments explaining why full page reloads are needed in these cases

## 2. Performance Optimizations

### Reduced Console Logging

- Removed unnecessary console.log statements in production
- Added conditional logging that only runs in development mode
- Created a debug utility for consistent logging

### Bundle Size Optimization

- Updated Next.js configuration for better performance
- Added optimizations for client components
- Improved code splitting and tree shaking

### Data Fetching Improvements

- Optimized React Query configuration
- Added structural sharing for better performance
- Reduced unnecessary refetching

### Performance Monitoring

- Added performance monitoring utilities
- Implemented native browser Performance API for tracking metrics
- Added performance measurement utilities
- Used PerformanceObserver for tracking navigation and paint timing

## 3. Next.js Configuration Updates

- Added `skipTrailingSlashRedirect` and `skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize` for better SPA behavior
- Enabled Partial Prerendering (PPR) for faster page loads
- Optimized image loading and font loading
- Improved webpack configuration for better performance

## 4. Additional Utilities

- Added debounce and throttle utilities for performance-sensitive operations
- Added memoization utilities for expensive computations
- Added safe access utilities for nested objects
- Added JSON parsing utilities that don't throw errors

## How to Test

1. Navigate between pages and verify that the page doesn't fully reload
2. Check the network tab in DevTools to ensure only API requests are made during navigation
3. Verify that authentication still works properly
4. Test performance using Lighthouse or the Performance tab in DevTools

## Dependencies

- No additional dependencies required - using native browser APIs

## Next Steps

1. Continue optimizing components for better performance
2. Consider implementing code splitting for large components
3. Add more performance monitoring and analytics
4. Optimize image and media loading further
