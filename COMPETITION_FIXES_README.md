# Vibtrix Competition System Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented for three critical issues in the Vibtrix competition system.

## üö® Issues Fixed

### 1. Payment System Authentication Failed
**Problem**: Users encountered "Payment system authentication failed. Please contact support." when attempting to make payments for competition participation.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing or invalid Razorpay API credentials
- Insufficient validation of API key format
- Poor error handling in payment authentication flow

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced `getRazorpaySettings()` function with better validation
- Improved `validateRazorpayKeys()` function with format checking
- Added timeout handling for API requests
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios
- Validation for Key ID format (must start with 'rzp_')
- Validation for Key Secret length (minimum 20 characters)

**Files Modified**:
- `nextjs/src/lib/razorpay.ts`

### 2. Multi-Round Competition Display Bug
**Problem**: In competitions with 3 rounds, when users advance from round 2 to round 3, their uploaded files from round 3 are not displaying properly on the competition page.

**Root Cause**:
- `visibleInCompetitionFeed` flag not properly set for round 3 entries
- Overly restrictive query conditions in competition feed API
- Round progression logic not handling advanced rounds correctly

**Fixes Applied**:
- Modified competition feed query to be more inclusive for round-specific views
- Added OR condition to show posts if round has started, even if visibility flag isn't set
- Enhanced round upload card to handle round end states better
- Improved visibility logic for non-disqualified participants

**Files Modified**:
- `nextjs/src/app/api/posts/competition-feed/route.ts`
- `nextjs/src/components/competitions/RoundUploadCard.tsx`

### 3. Missing Winner Display
**Problem**: Competition winners are not being displayed on the competition page, even for completed competitions.

**Root Cause**:
- Competition completion detection logic was incomplete
- Missing `completionReason` field in competition queries
- Winner calculation not accounting for manually completed competitions
- Poor error handling in winner fetching

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced completion detection to check both round end dates AND completion reason
- Added `completionReason` field to competition queries
- Improved error handling in `CompetitionWinners` component
- Better logging for debugging winner calculation issues
- Added retry logic for winner API calls

**Files Modified**:
- `nextjs/src/app/api/competitions/[competitionId]/winners/route.ts`
- `nextjs/src/components/competitions/CompetitionWinners.tsx`

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Tools Created

### Fix Script
Created `nextjs/scripts/fix-competition-issues.js` to:
- Check payment system configuration
- Fix round visibility issues across all competitions
- Update winner positions for completed competitions
- Provide comprehensive diagnostics

### Mobile App Enhancements
Enhanced `mobile-app/src/services/competitionService.ts` with:
- Payment order creation and verification functions
- Enhanced winner fetching with retry logic
- Round visibility checking functions
- Competition feed refresh capabilities

## üöÄ How to Apply the Fixes

### 1. Run the Fix Script
```bash
cd nextjs
node scripts/fix-competition-issues.js
```

### 2. Verify Payment Configuration
Ensure either environment variables or database settings are properly configured:

**Environment Variables** (recommended for development):
```bash
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxxxxxxx
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
```

**Database Settings** (for production):
- Access admin panel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Payment Settings
- Enter valid Razorpay Key ID and Secret
- Enable Razorpay payments

### 3. Test the Fixes

#### Payment System:
1. Try joining a paid competition
2. Verify payment modal opens correctly
3. Check that payment processing works without authentication errors

#### Round 3 Display:
1. Navigate to a 3-round competition
2. Check that round 3 entries are visible in the competition feed
3. Verify that users can upload to round 3 when qualified

#### Winner Display:
1. Check completed competitions
2. Verify winners are displayed correctly
3. Confirm winner positions and like counts are accurate

## üîç Monitoring and Debugging

### Payment Issues:
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify Razorpay credentials in admin settings
- Monitor payment logs in the database

### Round Visibility Issues:
- Use browser dev tools to check API responses
- Verify `visibleInCompetitionFeed` flags in database
- Check round start/end dates

### Winner Display Issues:
- Check competition completion status
- Verify winner positions in `competition_round_entries` table
- Monitor API responses for winner endpoints

## üìä Database Changes

The fixes may update the following database fields:
- `competition_round_entries.visibleInCompetitionFeed`
- `competition_round_entries.visibleInNormalFeed`
- `competition_round_entries.winnerPosition`
- `competitions.completionReason`

## üîÑ Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting the modified files to their previous versions
2. Running database migrations to reset visibility flags if needed
3. Clearing any cached competition data

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Review the server logs for API errors
3. Run the diagnostic script to identify configuration issues
4. Contact the development team with specific error details

**Note**: These fixes address the core issues but may require additional testing in your specific environment. Always test in a development environment before applying to production.
